The memory is kept local throughout the program so that function was no utilized. 
Declaring the arrays in a static manner makes the program too hard to maintain as well as runs into a segmentation fault problem.

Since there are no function calls that are not library functions inlining was not used.

There were no elements being passed into any function therefore there was no reason to pass the pointer instead of the element itself.
There was a consideration to use static array declaration instead of dynamic but that has not improved the performance beyonde a doubt nor are any of the declarations done inside the loops so this was not used.
Moreover, the arrays that were used were one dimentional arrays.
